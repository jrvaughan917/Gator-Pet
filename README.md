# Gator-Pet

A program I helped design, build, document, and create artwork for with three other students, written in Visual Basic.

The program involves a pet alligator which can be fed, washed, played with, and sent to work to make money.

The owner can use this money to buy more food.

The pet has bars for happiness, hunger, and cleanliness.

These bars decrease over time, and if they are empty the game is over.
